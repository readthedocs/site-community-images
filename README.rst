Read the Docs website images
============================

This is a place to store raw/editable source images that are used to produce
graphics on our website. These are the source images that may have layers, font
information, etc, and will be optimized for web use before we add the image to
our website source.

Vector images are easiest to track here. We probably want to enable Git LFS
before adding anything like PSD/AI/XMP image sources however.
